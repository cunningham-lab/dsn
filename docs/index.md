Put the first paragraph of the Cosyne abstract here.

Be a salesperson and talk about why people might be on this webpage and want to use this repo.

# Installation #
## Standard ##
These installation instructions are for users interested in learning degenerate solution spaces of systems, which are already implemented in the DSN systems library.
```bash
echo "hello world"
```

## Dev installation ##
If you intend to write some tensorflow code for your own system, then you want to use the development installation.  
#### Syntax hilighting ####
```python
import sys
learn_init = True;
if os.path.exists(initfname):

    resfile = np.load(resfname);
    assert(resfile['converged']);

else:
    print('here we go with the NF');
```
