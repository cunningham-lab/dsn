A.) Model of primary visual cortex (V1) Neurons: E - excitatory (black), P - parvalbumin- (blue), S - somatostatin- (red), and V - VIP-expressing (green).  Parameters: weights of the dynamics matrix $W$.  B.) The DSNs are conditioned on population-silenced ISN criticality.  C.) DSN distribution of the parameters of the V1 model conditioned on population-silened ISN criticality.  D.) Eigenmodes of the hessian of each DSN ordered by eigenvalue.  E. Behavioral sensitivity of the model along each mode of the hessian.
